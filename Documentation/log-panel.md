# Log panel

![Log panel](media/logpanel.png)

Any operation might produce an output that is displayed in the log panel. To open the panel, click on the "Log" button on the main toolbar. That button will also show the number of new log entries, when the panel isn't visualized.

Each log entry in the log list has a message type (Debug, Info, Warning, Error) which can be filtered with the buttons in the log toolbar.

On the right side of that toolbar, you can switch between "Simple" and "Detailed" view. The detailed view shows timestamp and code location.
